Purple America Part 5

I did not work with a buddy on this assignment

The assignment took me about an hour to do (not including the lecture video where
I follow you during class)

I liked the assignment because it allowed me to understand how hashmaps worked
to a better degree as well as remind me about important functions that a hash-
map can hold.
